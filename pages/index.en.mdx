## Create Modifications in a New Way [#mods]

We are developing a revolutionary platform for the entire STALKER community. Our team proudly presents a port of the original XRay Engine, specifically created for integration with the cutting-edge Unreal Engine 5. This port will provide STALKER players with a unique gaming experience by combining the best features of the original engine with the advanced capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

We have fully transferred the functionality and atmosphere of the original game to the new engine, allowing players to enjoy enhanced graphics effects, improved physics, and more realistic behavior of objects in the game world. This will create an immersive atmosphere, while preserving everything that has become the hallmark of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series.

Our platform will also provide the STALKER community with the opportunity to actively participate in the game's development. We are open to feedback and suggestions from players and carefully consider each idea. We strive to create a strong and friendly community where every STALKER can find their place and contribute to the game's development.

Join us to become part of this unique project. Together, we will create a platform that will provide STALKERs with unforgettable adventures, adrenaline-pumping action, and the opportunity to explore dangerous and mysterious corners of the Zone.
